<h1>Ticket listing</h1>

<p>In this screen an overview of the tickets is shown.
    On first startup after selecting a TRAC host the selection is all non-closed tickets sorted
    by priority and
    modification time.
    The filtering and sorting can be changed though the menu options <b>Filter</b> and
    <b>Sort</b>.
    Use the <b>Search</b> menu option for direct filtering of the ticket list.
</p>

<p>
    If after requesting the list changes appear on the serverthis will be notified in the
    notiofication bar.
    Refreshing the overview removes the notification.
</p>

<p>
    The difference between <b>Search</b> and <b>Filter</b> is that the second option is
    performed by the TRAC
    server and is remembered over sessions, just like the sort option.
