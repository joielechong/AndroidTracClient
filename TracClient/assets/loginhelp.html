<h1>Specify TRAC server</h1>
For more information on starting TracClient form an URL see <a href="url.html">this page</a>.
<p>
On this screen can be specified which TRAC server should be used.
<br>
You can save the information on your device. Be aware that passwords are stored in plain text, but on non rooted devices normally not available to other apps.
<br>
If saved information is available a dropdown box is presented to select one of the stored profiles.
</p>
<p>
If login information is required then it can also be entered.
<p>
Use the <b>Verify</b> button to check if the app can connect to the server.
With <b>OK</b> the server information is stored.
</p>
<p>
Normally the URL to fill in is TRAC-addrres appended with <code>/rpc</code> if no login information is neededand <code>/login/rpc</code> if this is needed.
<br>
Some example URLs:
<ul>
<li>TracClient RO: http://van-loon.xs4all.nl/TracClient/rpc
<br>No need for username and password
<li>TracClient RW: https://van-loon.xs4all.nl/TracClient/login/rpc
<br>A valid Username and password are needed and for this site the Selfsigned certifcate checkbox must be set.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Through the menu the saved profiles can be exported to the SD card. 
In that case the file TracClient.XML will be written in the directory TracClient. 
The import function again loads the information into the database, old information is discarded. 
Be aware that also the passwords will be exported.
</p>
<p>
The sort order is set to <code>priority&amp;modified&amp;desc=1</code>.
<br>
The filter is set to <code>max=500&amp;status!=closed</code>.
</p>
<h2>SSL considerations</h2>
<h3>Self Signed Certificates</h3>
If you get the error <u>No peer certificate</u> or <u>Trust anchor for certification path not found</u>, 
select <u>Accept Self Signed certificates</u>; this effectively disables the SSL protection.
<h3>ServerName Indication</h3>
At the moment the app does not support <u>ServerName Indiaction (SNI)</u>, this means that on systems with several hostnames with te same IP-address  the SSL verification can go wrong. 
This will be recognized and you will be asked to ignore the hostname verification error. 
This also breaks the protection offered by SSL but lets you use the site. I am looking for a safer solution.
