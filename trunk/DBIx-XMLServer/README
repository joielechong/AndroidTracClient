DBIx/XMLServer version 0.02
===========================

This module implements the whole process of generating an XML document
from a database query, in response to an HTTP request.  The mapping
from the DBI database to an XML structure is defined in a template
file, also in XML; this template is used not only to turn the data
into XML, but also to parse the query string.  To the user, the format
of the query string is very natural in relation to the XML data which
they will receive.

New in version 0.02:
  - Mechanism for including meta-data about search in result
  - Two ways of counting total number of matching rows
  - Alternative way of parsing XPaths; no more Parse::RecDescent
  - Named-parameter interface to functions
  - Ordering of results
  - User selection of templates
  - Many more tests
