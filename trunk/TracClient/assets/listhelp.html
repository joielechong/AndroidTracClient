<h1>Ticket listing</h1>
<p>In this screen an overview of the tickets is shown.
On first startup after selecting a TRAC host the selection is all non-closed tickets sorted by priority and 
modification time.
The filtering and sorting can be changed though the menu options <b>Filter</b> and <b>Sort</b>.
Use the <b>Search</b> menu option for direct filtering of the ticket list.
</p><p>
If after requesting the list changes appear on the serverthis will be notified in the notiofication bar. 
Refreshing the overview removes the notification. 
</p><p>
The difference between <b>Search</b> and <b>Filter</b> is that the second option is performed by the TRAC 
server and is remembered over sessions, just like the sort option.
