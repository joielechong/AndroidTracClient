This script is provided to allow you to have a random image appear on your 
page every time it is reloaded.  The server side includes version offers you 
link flexibility as well as coinciding random alt text and other variables 
which make it slightly more advanced than the Basic Random Image Displayer.

There are two files included with this script.
        1) README - This file, which explains installation
        2) ssi_rand_image.pl - The perl script which chooses the random image.

Below is a list of the changes that must be made to the ssi_rand_image.pl file 
in order for it to choose your random images correctly:

Inside the script you will see a list of variables, which must be defined in 
order for your script to work.  Below is a description of how to define each 
one:

$basedir = "http://your.host.xxx/path/to/images/";

        The standard portion of my url for each image.  This is the base 
location of each image that is referenced in the next array @images. The 
random image name chosen out of @images will be appended later on in the 
script to form a complete url.

@images = ("first_image.gif","second_image.jpg","third_image.gif");

        This is the name of each image.  They can be whatever format you would 
like, just make sure that when each of these filenames is appended to 
$basedir, they form a complete url path to the image.

@urls = ("http://url_linked/to/first_image",
         "http://url_linked/to/second_image",
         "http://url_linked/to/third_image");

        If you want each image to be accompanied with a link, then this is 
your chance to do it.  If you leave a field blank, then the script will assume 
you do not have a url for that image and it will not link the image to 
anything.  So therefore, if you did not have a link for the second image in 
the example above you could do:

        @urls = ("http://url_linked/to/first_image",
                 "",
                 "http://url_linked/to/third_image");

@alt = ("First WWW Page","Second WWW Page","Third WWW Page");

        This is the same idea as the @urls array.  Each of these alt text fields 
corresponds to the image located in the same array spot in @images, as well 
as the same url located in the @urls array.  If you don't want the alt text 
for a certain image just leave the field blank as in the example of @urls 
above.
---

There are also a number of options that you will need to define and decide 
whether to use.  They are located directly below the variables in the 
ssi_rand_image.pl script.

$uselog = "1";            # 1 = YES; 0 = NO

        At this point you must decide whether or not you want to use the 
logging feature.  for most practical purposes this will not be used, but some 
people may find it helpful either for keeping stats or seeing which images get 
picked the most.  All the logging feature will record is the image, date, and 
remote host that saw the image.  Should you choose to turn this option on, you 
will need to define two more variables:

   $logfile = "/home/mattw/public_html/links/ssi_image";
                The location of the log file.  This must be in a 
        readable/writable directory and given read/write permissions for all 
        users so that the server's uid may edit the log file.
   $date = `/usr/bin/date`; chop($date);
                This is the location of your date function enclosed in '`' so 
        that it will be executed when it is called upon.  It returns the date 
        function for logging purposes only.

$link_image = "1";        # 1 = YES; 0 = NO

        If you turn this variable off you do not need to worry about what is 
in the @urls variable.  It simply won't link any of your images.

$align = "left";

        This is the way in which you want your image aligned.  Valid choices 
for Netscape include: left, right, middle, absmiddle, bottom, and absbottom.

$border = "2";

        This is the size you want your border to be.  Mainly occurs when you 
have images linked the border turns blue, and in Netscape you can control the 
size.  Setting this to zero causes there to be no border.

You can turn off both align and border by setting them equal to "" like:
$align = ""; or $border = "";

Server Side Includes

I hope that you already know how to accomplish a Server Side Includes, and 
therefore I am not going to go into detail about how.  Two things you can 
check for are:

1) Ask your sysadmin if you have access to server side includes and what you 
need to change about your file to make them work.  This often involves 
changing your .html files to .shtml.

2) If you really don't know anything about Server Side Includes, you can 
check out a great tutorial that NCSA has developed;  located at:

        http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/includes.html

________________________________________________________________________

HISTORY:
Version 1.1:	9/30	- Corrections made to random image displayer to 
			  add functionality of alt text, links, etc... 
			  to each random image..
Version 1.2:	11/4	- Errors in alt="" tag not being noticed 
			  correctly, and spacing being messed up fixed!

________________________________________________________________________

The Random Image Script was written to be useful, and comes with no 
warranties, express or implied.  You can use this script freely, however you 
want.  You can modify it however you like, I would just ask two things:

1) Register it with me when you use it:  This means send me the url of where 
it is implemented.  It can be done through the on-line form located at:
        http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/implement.html

2) Keep my name in the scripts (and possibly on the html page) somewhere.

And last of all, ENJOY THE SCRIPT!
