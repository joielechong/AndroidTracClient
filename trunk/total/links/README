This is a script built for the World Wide Web that allows users to freely
add links to your page in the sections that you specify.

File included in this script:
        1) links.html - The HTML File users see
        2) links.pl - The guts of the operations
        3) README - This file (Installation information)
        4) changelinks.pl - This file will put " around all your urls you may 
                            have in your previous version.

If you have used the 2.0 version or previous you will need to manually edit 
your links.html file and change all the <meta XXXX> tags to <!--XXXX--> tags.

To Install:
a) You must have access to your server's cgi-bin
b) Put the links.pl file into your server's cgi-bin
c) Put the links.html file into any dir of your choice (must be user writable)

LINKS.PL
This file is the file that pulls in your links.html and makes the necessary 
changes to your links.html.  It will add the url of the user's choice.  You 
must chmod this file 755 and place it in your server's cgi-bin.
        EDIT VARIABLES IN THIS FILE:
                $filename = "real/location/of/links.html" 
                        Real Location of your links.html file.
                $links_url = "http://your.server/actual/url/of/links.html" 
                        URL Location of links.html file.
                $linkspl = "http://your.host.xxx/cgi-bin/links.pl";
                        URL Location of links.pl.
                $datecom = "/path/to/date"
                        Location of the 'date' command on your system

LINKS.HTML
This file contains all of the links that users have added.  Users will be 
automatically returned to this document.  You must place this document in a 
directory with 777 file access and then chmod this file 777.  You will need to 
edit the action="" part of the <form> tag so that points to your links.pl file 
at your cgi-bin.  You will also want to change the bottom link so users can get 
back to your home page.  You can change anything above the <form> tag also... 
Just don't change the <!--XXXX--> tags unless you want to edit the script.

CHANGELINKS.PL
        This file will change version 2.0 links file into a version 2.1 links 
fiel, which are also parsable by a script called makelinkdb.pl which can 
create a link database for my random link script.  Simply modify the $file 
variable in this script to point to your links.html file and then run the 
script.  It may not be a bad idea to make a backup copy of your link file 
before hand, just in case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hopefully this is enough information to get your script up and running.  If 
you want more information please mail me.

I love to hear feedback and if anyone can improve on this it would be greatly 
appreciated.  There is no cost to use this script and you can freely modify it 
any way you wish.  All that I ask is that you possibly include my name some 
where in the file (not necessarily viewable by all users) and I would like to 
know the url of where it is being used so that I can see my script in action!

HISTORY
Version 1.0     5/14 - Original links.pl created
Version 2.0     5/20 - Patrick Kane re-wrote almost the entire script to make 
                       it work better
Version 2.1     8/5  - Added the count of links and date last modified to the 
                       links.html file.
                     - Changed all my <meta> tags to the appropriate comment 
                       tag <!--XXXX-->
                     - Added a datecom variable in the realization that just 
                       the 'date' command was interfering with some of the 
                       date commands located in the cgi-bin of some servers.
                     - An HTML checker to remove all HTML tags a user might 
                       try to put around their title.
                     - Added quotes around the url to make the structure more 
                       HTML compatible.
