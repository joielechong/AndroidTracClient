This script can be used as a universal WWW form --> E-mail gateway.  There are 
just a few restrictions on the HTML Forms and what they have to have in 
them.  The script works for both the POST and GET form methods.

The script, FormMail.pl, needs to be placed in your server's cgi-bin and the 
anonymous WWW user must have the ability to read/execute the script.  If 
you do not have access to your server's cgi-bin, yet you can execute cgi 
scripts, you may want to try adding a .cgi extension to the FormMail.pl, 
so you could move it to FormMail.cgi.

Setting Up the FormMail Script:
===============================

The FormMail.pl script does not have to be extensively configured to get 
it to work.  There are only two variables in the perl file which you will 
need to define along with changing the top line of your script to match 
the location of you Perl interpreter.

Necessary Variables:
--------------------

  $mailprog = "/usr/lib/sendmail";
	This variable must define the location to your server's sendmail 
    program.  If this is incorrect, form results will not be mailed to you.

  @referers = ('www.worldwidemart.com','worldwidemart.com','206.31.72.203');
	This array allows you to define the domains that you will allow 
    forms to reside on and use your FormMail script.  If a user tries to 
    put a form on another server, that is not www.worldwidemart.com, they 
    will receive an error message when someone tries to fill out their form.

Your formmail program is now configured.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Form Configuration:
===================

The action of your form needs to point towards this script (obviously), and 
the method must be POST or GET in capital letters.  Version 1.5 of FormMail 
offers many new ways to code your form to tailor the resulting HTML page 
and the way the script performs.  Below is a list of form fields you can 
use and how to implement them.

Necessary Form Fields:
======================

There is only one form field that you must have in your form, for 
FormMail to work correctly.  This is the recipient field.

Field: recipient

Description: This form field allows you to specify to whom you wish for your 
form results to be mailed.  Most likely you will want to configure this 
option as a hidden form field with a value equal to that of your e-mail 
address.

Syntax:

<input type=hidden name="recipient" value="email@your.host.xxx">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional Form Fields:
=====================

Field: subject

Description: The subject field will allow you to specify the subject that 
you wish to appear in the e-mail that is sent to you after this form has 
been filled out.  If you do not have this option turned on, then the 
script will default to a message subject: WWW Form Submission

Syntax:

If you wish to choose what the subject is:
<input type=hidden name="subject" value="Your Subject">

To allow the user to choose a subject:
<input type=text name="subject">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: email

Description: This form field will allow the user to specify their return 
e-mail address.  If you want to be able to return e-mail to your user, I 
strongly suggest that you include this form field and allow them to fill 
it in.  This will be put into the From: field of the message you receive.

Syntax:

<input type=text name="email">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: realname

Description:  The realname form field will allow the user to input their 
real name.  This field is useful for identification purposes and will 
also be put into the From: line of your message header.

Syntax: 

<input type=text name="realname">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: redirect

Description:  If you wish to redirect the user to a different URL, rather 
than having them see the default response to the fill-out form, you can 
use this hidden variable to send them to a pre-made HTML page.

Syntax:

To choose the URL they will end up at:
<input type=hidden name="redirect" value="http://your.address/to/file.html">

To allow them to specify a URL they wish to travel to once the form is 
filled out:
<input type=text name="redirect">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: required

Version Added: 1.3

Description: You can now require for certain fields in your form to be 
filled in before the user can successfully submit the form.  Simply place 
all field names that you want to be mandatory into this field.  If the 
required fields are not filled in, the user will be notified of what they 
need to fill in, and a link back to the form they just submitted will be 
provided.

Syntax:

If you want to require that they fill in the email and phone fields in 
your form, so that you can reach them once you have received the mail, 
use a syntax like:
<input type=hidden name="required" value="email,phone">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: env_report

Version Added: 1.3

Description: Allows you to have Environment variables included in the 
e-mail message you receive after a user has filled out your form.  Useful 
if you wish to know what browser they were using, what domain they were 
coming from or any other attributes associated with environment 
variables.  The following is a short list of valid environment variables 
that might be useful:

REMOTE_HOST	- Sends the hostname making a request.
REMOTE_ADDR	- Sends the IP address of the remote host making the request.
REMOTE_USER	- If server supports authentication and script is 
		  protected, this is the username they have authenticated as.
		  *This is not usually set.*
REMOTE_IDENT	- If HTTP server supports RFC 931 identification, then 
		  this variable will be set to the remote user name 
		  retrieved from the server. *This is not usually set.*
HTTP_USER_AGENT	- The browser the client is using to send the request.  
		  General format: software/version library/version

There are others, but these are a few of the most useful.

Syntax:

If you wanted to find the remote host and browser sending the request, 
you would put the following into your form:
<input type=hidden name="env_report" value="REMOTE_HOST,HTTP_USER_AGENT">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: sort

Version Added: 1.4

Description: This field allows you to choose the order in which you wish 
for your variables to appear in the e-mail that FormMail generates.  You 
can choose to have the field sorted alphabetically or specify a set order 
in which you want the fields to appear in your mail message.  By leaving 
this field out, the order will simply default to the order in which the 
browsers sends the information to the script (which isn't always the 
exact same order they appeared in the form.)  When sorting by a set order 
of fields, you should include the phrase "order:" as the first part of 
your value for the sort field, and then follow that with the field names 
you want to be listed in the e-mail message, separated by commas.

Syntax:

To sort alphabetically:
<input type=hidden name="sort" value="alphabetic">

To sort by a set field order:
<input type=hidden name="sort" value="order:name1,name2,etc...">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: print_config

Version Added: 1.5

Description: print_config allows you to specify which of the config 
variables you would like to have printed in your e-mail message.  By 
deafult, no config fields are printed to your e-mail.  This is because 
the important form fields, like email, subject, etc... are included in 
the header of the message.  However some users have asked for this option 
so they can have these fields printed in the body of the message.  The 
config fields that you wish to have printed shoul dbe in the value 
attribute of your input tag separated by commas.

Syntax:

If you want to print the email and subject fields in the body of your 
message, you would place the following form tag:
<input type=hidden name="print_config" value="email,subject">

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: title

Version Added: 1.3

Description: This form field allows you to specify the title and header 
that will appear on the resulting page if you do not specify a redirect URL.

Syntax:

If you wanted a title of 'Feedback Form Results':
<input type=hidden name="title" value="Feedback Form Results">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: return_link_url

Version Added: 1.3

Description:  This field allows you to specify a URL that will appear, as 
return_link_title, on the following report page.  This field will not 
be used if you have the redirect field set, but it is useful if you allow 
the user to receive the report on the following page, but want to offer 
them a way to get back to your main page.

Syntax:

<input type=hidden name="return_link_url" 
				     value="http://your.host.xxx/main.html">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: return_link_title

Version Added: 1.3

Description: This is the title that will be used to link the user back to 
the page you specify with return_link_url.  The two fields will be shown 
on the resulting form page as:

<ul>
<li><a href="return_link_url">return_link_title</a>
</ul>

Syntax:

<input type=hidden name="return_link_title" value="Back to Main Page">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: background

Version Added: 1.3

Description: This form field allow you to specify a background image 
that will appear if you do not have the redirect field set.  This image 
will appear as the background to the form results page.

Syntax:

<input type=hidden name="background" value="http://your.host.xxx/image.gif">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: bgcolor

Version Added: 1.3

Description:  This form field allow you to specify a bgcolor for the 
form results page in much the way you specify a background image.  This 
field should not be set if the redirect field is.

Syntax:

For a background color of White:
<input type=hidden name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: text_color

Version Added: 1.3

Description: This field works in the same way as bgcolor, except that it 
will change the color of your text.

Syntax:

For a text color of Black:
<input type=hidden name="text_color" value="#000000">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: link_color

Version Added: 1.3

Description: Changes the color of links on the resulting page.  Works in 
the same way as text_color.  Should not be defined if redirect is.

Syntax:

For a link color of Red:
<input type=hidden name="link_color" value="#FF0000">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: vlink_color

Version Added: 1.3

Description: Changes the color of visited links on the resulting page.  
Works exactly the same as link_color.  Should not be set if redirect is.

Syntax:

For a visited link color of Blue:
<input type=hidden name="vlink_color" value="#0000FF">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field: alink_color

Version Added: 1.4

Description: Changes the color of active links on the resulting page. 
Works exactly the same as link_color.  Should not be set if redirect is.

Syntax:

For a visited link color of Blue:
<input type=hidden name="alink_color" value="#0000FF">

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any other form fields that appear in your script will be mailed back to 
you and displayed on the resulting page if you do not have the redirect 
field set.  There is no limit as to how many other form fields you can 
use with this form, except the limits imposed by browsers and your server.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the possible uses of this script are:

1) You want to have a form that will be mailed to you, but aren't sure how to 
   write the scripting for it.
2) You are the webmaster of your site and want to allow users to use forms, 
   but not to have their own cgi-bin directories, which can cause 
   security risks to your system.  You can set this script up and then 
   allow all users to run off of it.
3) Want to have one script to parse all of your html forms and mail them 
   to you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

History:
Version 1.0     6/11 -  This script was created.
Version 1.1     8/3  -  A major hole in the script which allowed users to run 
                        commands under your server's uid was disabled, thanks 
                        to Paul Phillips, who noticed the error.
                     -  The ability to redirect the user to a specified HTML 
                        file after they filled out a form was added.
Version 1.2     9/23 -  If the form field is one of the required or optional 
                        'special' fields, such as redirect, recipient, 
                        subject, email, realname, etc... the script will not 
                        print these fields to either your mail message or to 
                        the user's screen when they are returned to a generic 
                        form response.  It helps you so that things do not 
                        get duplicated.
Version 1.3	1/21 -  Much needed update finally completed
		     -  Added form fields: env_report, bgcolor, 
		        background, link_color, vlink_color, title,
		        text_color, return_link_title, return_link_url 
			and required.
		     -  Security hole, which allowed any user on any 
			system to bum off of your formmail script, has been 
			plugged up with the @referers variable.
		     -  Report style in return html and e-mail touched 
			up a bit.
Version 1.4	1/23 -  Added options: sort, alink_color
		     -  Fixed a few bugs from Version 1.3, namely the fact 
			that the link_colors weren't working well.
		     -  FormMail now supports both the GET and POST methods.
Version 1.5	2/5  -  Sorting of Fields in E-Mail Response Fixed.
		     -  print_config option added.
