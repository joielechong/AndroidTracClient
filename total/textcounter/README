WWWCount Text Version 1.0 is a simple program which allows you to include 
a text counter on any page.  You can also include the date since it began 
counting, a link to a help page, etc...  This program was designed for 
anyone to use, from a user who just wants a text counter on his or her 
home page to a system administrator who wants to make it easy for anyone 
on their server to use the count program.  Multiple counters can be set 
up, with the need for only one script to manage them all.  You can 
specify what hosts are allowed to access this program, and can even allow 
certain directories or exclude certain directories from being able to use 
this script.  Details on how to install and use this script are available 
below.

This package should have come with 2 files:
	1) README 	- This file.  Installation Instructions, 
			  Disclaimer, Copyright
	2) WWWCount.cgi - The CGI/Perl program which does all of the work.

Installation:
=============

WWWCount.cgi
------------

The first thing you will need to do when you get ahold of this script is 
make sure that the first line of the script correctly points to the Perl 
executable on your system.  If you don't know where this is for sure, use 
the command:

which perl
or
whereis perl

from your Unix shell.

There are also several Variables and Options you will need to configure.  
The instructions below provide examples and instructions of how to do so.

VARIABLE CONFIGURATION:
	$data_dir = "/path/to/a/data/directory/";
		The $data_dir variable should specify the path to the 
		directory under which all of th data files will be stored.
		This path must end with a '/' and it NEEDS to be writable by 
		your web server.  This means that you most likely will need 
		to chmod this directory 777.  You can do this by executing:

			chmod 777 /path/to/a/data/directory/

		It is suggested that you make this directory a brand new 
		directory for the sole purpose of holding the data files.  A 
		new data file will be created for each page you add your text
		counter to.  You may think that this is not the best way to 
		do this, but it is not all bad, and is beneficial in some 
		ways:

			1) If you use this system wide, it is likely that 
			   many pages will load at the same time, meaning 
		 	   this script would have to try and edit the main 
			   file if it was all included in one database.  
			   This file can lead to slow downs (if I locked the
			   file each time it was called) or it could lead to 
			   mangled data if I didn't.  That is one reason I 
			   chose to use separate files.
			2) The files created for the data are EXTREMELY 
			   small, taking up between 15 and 30 bytes (yes, 
			   you heard correctly, bytes).
			3) Access time is faster as I know exactly what 
			   file to open, rather than flipping through lines 
			   of a database if it was all in one file.
			(BTW, this explanation was more for people who 
			may have questioned why I chose to do it this way.  
			Most of you could care less about these last 3 points)
		  	:-)

	@valid_uri = ("/");
		The @valid_uri array allows you to allow this script to 
		be used only under a certain directory of your server.  Say 
		your username is fred and you are on a server called 
		host.com, therefore all of your pages reside under: 
		http://www.host.com/~fred/.  You only want those pages under
		that directory to be able to use this program, so you set the 
		@valid_uri variable to ("/~fred"); or you can allow you and 
		your friend joe to use it by setting the @valid_uri variable
		to: ("/~fred","/~joe");  Or if you are a sysadmin who wants 
		to allow everyone to use this script, simply set this array 
		to ("/"); as I have shown above.

	@invalid_uri = ("");
		Most likely you will just comment this line out if you do 
		not wish to block access to a certain part of your server.
		But take the example of fred above.  He decides to be real 
		cool and open this program up to anyone on the server by 
		setting @valid_uri = ("/");  His arch enemy bob is also on 
		the server though, and fred despises him so much that he 
		wants to block access to this guy, cause bob is such a jerk.
		So fred sets his @invalid_uri = ("/~bob"); and bob can't use 
		his counter. MU HA HA HA.  I'm sure there are other cool uses
		for this too.  Like if you sell virtual domains and want to 
		charge people before they can use your counter script, you 
		put their URI in here until they pay or something.  I dunno. 
		The story was fun to write, and that's all that matters. :-)

OPTION SETTINGS:
	$show_link = "http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/";
		If you put a URL into this option, then the actual number 
		returned by the WWWCount script will be linked to this 
		URL.  This is useful if you want to link to my site 
		(PLEASE?!) or link to a help page explaining how the user 
		on your system can set up their own text counter.  or if 
		you just want to have a pointless link on your number.  
		Setting this to a null value like "" or 0 will take out the
		link.

	$auto_create = "1";
		Suggested value here is 1, or else you will have to 
		create data files by hand.  This allows users who reside 
		under the @valid_uri array to create a new counter for their 
		page simply by putting the Server Side Include reference into
		their page.  Otherwise the maintainer will have to create a 
		data file which looks like:

			January 1, 2000||0

		Obviously putting the correct date into the script and 
		changing 0 to whatever you want to start the number at.  
		This file MUST be writable by the web server meaning you 
		need to chmod it 777.  This means other users on your 
		system can write to it too, which is another reason to allow 
		auto-create.  Auto-Create will leave it chmoded so only the 
		web server can write to it.

	$show_date = "1";
		If this variable is on, then the date on which you began 
		the count will appear with your actual count number.  It 
		will look like: 

			[Count] hits since [Date]

		If this is turned off, you allow users more control over 
		their text and it will simply print:

			[Count]

		The user can then supply the date if they wish.

HOW TO CALL THIS SCRIPT FROM YOUR PAGE?

Calling this program is really very simple.  As I have mentioned before, 
you will need Server Side Includes turned on on your server before you 
can use this program.  Talk to your system administrator or visit my 
Frequently Asked Questions section for more information on server side 
includes.  If you know they are turned on, or want to try and find out, 
put the following code into your HTML document:

<!--#exec cgi="/virtual/path/to/counter.pl"-->

So, if I have my counter.pl (or counter.cgi if I have to rename it for 
my server) program located at 
http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/demos/textcounter/counter.pl, then I 
would put the following into any HTML document a wanted a count to appear in:

<!--#exec cgi="/scripts/demos/textcounter/counter.pl"-->

_____________________________________________________________________________

Well, that covers all of the options and variables, and I explained these 
in such detail that hopefully I won't get swamped by help mail for this 
script. :-D (Yah right!)  But please, before you ask for help, follow the 
steps at the top of this document.  You probably won't get an answer from 
myself or the help staff if your answer is in the Frequently Asked 
Questions at my site.

HISTORY:
Version 1.0	- 03/14/96 -	WWWCount (Text Version) Released.
Version 1.1	- 04/25/96 -	@valid_referer array and checking 
				removed.  Because server side includes can 
				only be used locally, it is unnecessary.  
				Also, it was causing many counters to 
				incorrectly display error messages.
