=head1 NAME

DBIx::XMLServer::TextField - text field type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements the built-in text field type of DBIx::XMLServer.
Only the B<where> method is overridden from the base class.

=head2 B<where> method

  $sql_expression = $text_field->where($condition);

This field type understands three types of condition:  a string comparison
with wildcards; a regular expression test; and a not-null test.

=over

=item Condition: C<=wild*card?expression>

If the first character of the condition is '=', then the rest of the
condition is interpreted as a string, possible containing wildcards,
to which the column is to be compared.  First the string is escaped by
the DBI system; then any characters '%' and '_' are escaped by
prefixing with '\'; then the characters '*' and '?'  are replaced by
'%' and '_' respectively.  The resulting SQL expression is one of
the following:

  <field> = <string>
  <field> LIKE <string>

depending on whether the string contains any wildcards.

=item Condition: C<~regex>

If the first character of the condition is a tilde '~', then the rest of
the condition is interpreted as a regular expression.  It is escaped by
the DBI system, and the SQL expression is

  <field> RLIKE <string> .

=item Condition: C<> (empty)

If the condition is empty, then the SQL expression is

  <field> IS NOT NULL .

=item Condition: C<!>

If the condition is the single character '!', then the SQL expression is

  <field> IS NULL .
